# Weather Widget

A lightweight, embeddable weather widget built with React.

## Features
- Dynamic location detection from NT property Google Maps links
- Weather forecasts for each property
- Fallback to The Pineapple üçç if location not found
- Secure headers and content delivery
- Proper React/ReactDOM loading management

## Implementation Journey

### Current Implementation
The widget uses direct script embedding with managed dependencies:
```html
<script src="https://weather-widget-pied.vercel.app/embed/widget.js"></script>
```

### Location Handling
The widget extracts coordinates from National Trust property pages:
```javascript
// From property's "Get Directions" link
destination=54.68729%2C-6.657566
```

Fallback Location:
- The Pineapple, Dunmore (56.0729, -3.8326)
- A folly built in 1761 near Airth, Scotland

### Development History

#### 1. Vanilla JavaScript Approach
First attempt using pure DOM manipulation:
```javascript
document.createElement('div')
// Direct DOM manipulation was fun but limiting
```
**Lessons**: While straightforward, lacked component reusability and state management and George said I'd be working with React!

#### 2. Global Script Injection
Attempted dynamic React component loading:
```javascript
window.WeatherWidgetAppComponent = App;
```
**Challenges**: Script context isolation and component serialization issues

#### 3. IFrame Implementation
Explored for better isolation:
```html
<iframe src="weather-widget.html"></iframe>
```
**Outcome**: Added complexity without significant benefits and just INCREDIBLY ugly.
